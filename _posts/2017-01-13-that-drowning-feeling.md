title: that drowning feeling
---

your eyes lock on theirs  
as you step step step  
into the ocean  
your hands start shaking  
ever so slightly

the sea, waves bobbing to and fro  
you close the distance between  
the two of you  
eyes still locked like crab pincers  
and the air smells of freshly battered  
fish and chips and deep-fried  
calamari  

you’re so close now you could touch ‘em  
feet stare at feet  
their arm could reach out to yours  
without even stretching  
but you  
walk  
past  

deeper into the sea  
until the saltwater closes over  
and you try to speak  
but only bubbles escape  
your lungs are prisoners  
of underwater Alcatraz  

steps no longer go anywhere  
as the current now pulls you along  
like you’re its little child  
and you want to let go  
and you want to go home  
but mommy says no  
but mommy says you  
must  
drown

title: ding-ding, it's doubt
---
ding-ding the screen spills light  
as her text arrives  
all bubbly and sweet  

quick think of a reply  
you think, and ideas swim by  
like salmon and you (a bear) catch one  
(just one)  
hungry  

fingers dash across tainted glass  
and finally hover over “send”  
…  
you tap and it flies away  

then time arrives with all her hell  
staring you down minutes at a time  
every one of ‘em sinking you  
deeper and deeper and deeper  
and deeper into doubt  

this is when the war starts  
in the Cerebral Kingdom  
self vs. perceived self  
you vs. your ego  

armed and ready in formation  
the soldiers raise their spears  
and then  

ding-ding the screen spills light  
as her text arrives  
all bubbly and sweet

iridescent lights booming  
along, dancing with the music  
shaking the floors  
and the bodies  

they sway, they drink  
they chatter and kiss with  
their bitter tongues  
dripping with vodka and smoke  

the technicolors mix into bleeding  
beams of light shone up into the  
drywall roof; the thump thumping  
hump humping of the bodies

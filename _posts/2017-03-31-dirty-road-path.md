title: dirty road path
---
the night air is cold  
(crisp)  
to the touch  

my footsteps barely make noise  
tap tap tapping across  
the dirty road ends here  
and here the grass snakes by  
its curls hugging the path's  
edges  

the grass grows tall  
and yet barely taps your  
skirt  

are your eyes truly that black  
or is it just really dark  
here?  

you take a step and  
i jump  
it's starting  
the pricks of dull pins  
make their way across my arms  
scarred red and raw  

another step and i can hear you breathe  
soft short breaths  
your lips slightly part  
your black eyes shut  

and then i feel the tug  

deep down in the pit of my stomach  
it starts  
and it pulls  
(lightly)  
and tugs  

arms and legs still in silence  
i still hear your short breaths  
growing louder now  
(louder)  
and it pulls harder now  
(harder)  
i feel it ripping  
the red flesh hanging on its last thread  
stretched like a string  
and now your breaths  
(so loud)  
are all i can hear  
(please)  
stop pulling  
it hurts  
(please)  
stop  

soft and short once more  
(your breath)  
the night air bites  
and i look down  
and all i see  
is you

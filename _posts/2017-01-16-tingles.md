your voice glides along my ears like  
hot honey on aluminium at an angle  
which refracts the evening sunlight  
into your chocolatey eyes, glittering  

with skin as soft as untouched sand  
on some uninhabited island  
you are tingling (to the touch)  

no wonder guys fawn over  
your pictures like hungry seagulls  
around a rich kidâ€™s picnic table  

your tits are damn huge
